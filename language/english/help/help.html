    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4>
    <p class="even">This is the UHQ_GeoLocate XOOPS Module.</p>
    <p>This module is meant to provide geolocation services given an IP address to other XOOPS modules and currently supports the following information services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FreeGeoIP (Web API)</li>
        <li>IPInfoDB v3 (Web API)</li>
        <li>IP2Location (Binary Lookup)</li>
        <li>MaxMind (Web API)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="odd">Install / Update / Uninstall</h4>

    <p class="even">There are no special requirements for installing this module.  Sample binary lookup files for IP2Location are provided and will be moved into the XOOPS Trust Path and automatically removed by the installer</p>

    <p class="even">Special care has been taken with each release to automate any changes required between releases.  The use cases are not perfect, but it is a driving goal of the UHQ module series to be as administratively friendly as possible.</p>

    <p class="even">Upon uninstall, the module will remove the IP2Location binary files from the XOOPS Trust Path, regardless if they were part of the module distribution or not.  Please keep this in mind if you are subscribing to the IP2Location service and don't have a backup copy before you uninstall this module.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4 class="odd">Operating instructions</h4>

    <p class="even">There are no special operating instructions for this module.  Modules which interact with the information this one provides should do so automatically and w/o an effort.</p>

    <h4 class="odd">Tutorial</h4>

    <p class="even">The module itself is simple, hence there is no tutorial.</p>
